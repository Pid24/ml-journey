# 🧠 ML Journey — Week 1: Titanic Data Exploration

This repository marks the beginning of my journey from Web Developer to Machine Learning Engineer.  
Each week, I document my progress, experiments, and insights through real datasets and hands-on projects.

## 📊 Week 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (Titanic Dataset)

**Goal:**  
Understand the Titanic dataset using Python data tools (`numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`).

**Key Steps:**
1. Load dataset (`train.csv`)
2. Clean and inspect missing values
3. Visualize passenger age distribution
4. Analyze survival rate patterns

**Tools Used:**
- Python 3.13  
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

**Notebook:**  
[`notebooks/data-101.ipynb`](notebooks/data-101.ipynb)

## 🧠 Insights
- Majority of passengers did not survive (~62%).  
- Most passengers were aged 20–40.  
- Some columns (Age, Cabin) contain missing data.  
- ‘Fare’ and ‘Pclass’ are negatively correlated — higher class means higher fare.

## 📚 Next Step
Week 2 → Build a simple machine learning model to predict survival using `scikit-learn`.
